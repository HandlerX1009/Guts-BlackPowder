# Guts-BlackPowder

**This is a repository for the modules of the game, exploiting is absolutely NOT tolerated**

## Funcs

This module is required for many of the core functions in main, without this it would basically be useless.

## ChargingHandler

Module is required for the sprinting part of the script, very important towards the script.

# Will i ever release the full verison?
Absolutely not. This is just a container for scripts, you have to piece it together if you ever really want to use the full thing.
